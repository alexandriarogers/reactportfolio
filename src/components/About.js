    <p>I am a motivated student currently attending Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. 
      With 3+ years of technical support, and a keen interest in software development. 
      I have demonstrated the ability to work individually and/or within a team while delivering 
      viable solutions that consistently met assignment/project goals. I am constantly working 
      toward learning new technologies and how to adapt them into my current skillset to 
      help improve my job performance and ability.
